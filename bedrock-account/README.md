# Bedrock account setup 


This repository provides a sample implementation of an AWS Lambda function that interacts with Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service for building generative AI applications. The Lambda function is deployed using the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM).

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- AWS SAM CLI installed


Here's a summary of the deployment steps:

- Navigate to the project directory.
- Build the SAM application using `sam build`.
- Deploy the application using sam `deploy -g`. This will prompt you for deployment options and guide you through the process.
