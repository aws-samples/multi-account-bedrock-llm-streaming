Instead of giving them a set of rules like \"if it has four legs and a tail, it's a cat,\" you would show them many examples of different animals, along with their correct labels (e.g., pictures of cats labeled as \"cat,\" pictures of dogs labeled as \"dog,\" and so on).\n",

The algorithm learns to recognize patterns in the data and builds a model that can make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed with rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more data the machine learning model is trained on, the better it becomes at making accurate predictions or decisions. This approach allows computers to perform tasks that are difficult to program using traditional methods, such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and many others.\n",
